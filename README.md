# Premise
- Computer Society audience driven game
## Basic game starting concept
- there are rounds
- if you fail a round the game ends
- object is to stay alive for as many rounds
- you're given an inventory of mathematical symbols (numbers, operations, etc)
- each round
    - you must get to a target value by creating a mathematical expression with you're symbols
    - you comsume the symbols use use in your expression
    - if you don't get the target value you fail
## Meeting Organization
- members write down an **ANY** addition to the game (i.e. adding another operation)
- the note will be folded up and placed up front
- once we have some amount of suggestions we'll pick one at random
    - this will then be live implemented as fast as possible
